To : Engineering and Purchasing Manager, 

We would like to take this chance to introduce our new series of Capacitor : 
Filter Capacitor

Application : 
-High Frequency and Current AC, DC filter circuit; EMC Filter application

Electrical Characteristic :
-Capacitance : customer design
-Tol : =A1=D310%, =A1=D35% at 23=A2J 1kHz
-Voltage : customer designed, AC & DC is available
-Testing Voltage : 1.3 x Un 60sec (can be customer design)=A1V DC application
                             : According to EN132400 =A1V AC application
-Low ESR and ESL
-High Current carrying capacity
-Temperature range : -55 ~ 85=A2J (full voltage rating)

Should you have any inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact us. Quotation and samples will be sent upon request. Thanks for your kind attention and look forward to hearing from you soon.
